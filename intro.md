# Welcome to the 21st Century Weather Software Wiki

## The Software Engineering Team

The Software Engineering Team currently consists of 2 members:

- [Paul Gregory](https://www.21centuryweather.org.au/profile/paul-gregory) @ University of Melbourne
- [Sam Green](https://www.21centuryweather.org.au/profile/sam-green) @ UNSW

## How to get help from the Software Engineering Team

The Software Engineering team can be contacted for support through:

- The Software Support Category on Cumulus ([Cumulus Software Categry](https://21centuryweather.discourse.group/c/software-support/32)).
- One-on-one video call through Microsoft Teams or Zoom.
- In person meetings with local Software Engineering team members.
- Code Workshops (coming soon).

The Software Support Category on Cumulus is the *preferred contact method* as it allows the whole team to see the query, then whoever is best equipped to answer will do as soon as they can. 
- Just open a new ‘Topic’ in the Category and give as much detail about your problem/request/comment as you can. 
- The benefit of using Cumulus means topics won’t disappear and you may find that your issue has already been asked and fixed. 
- It also gives the chance of others in the 21st Century Weather community to give their response. 
- There will inevitably be issues that can’t be solved within 21st Century Weather and these can be directed to the ACCESS-NRI/Hive forums if they are suitable for that platform.

Coming Soon - Fortnightly Code Workshops. This will be an hour long session where you can bring your code in for help/ideas/review.
